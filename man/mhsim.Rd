\arguments{
\item{niter}{Number of simulation iterations or games.}

\item{seed}{Seed integer to set in `set.seed()`.}

\item{ndoors}{Total quantity of doors for game simulations.}

\item{ndec1}{Door index to *always* choose in decision 1.}

\item{ndec2}{Door index to *always* choose in decision 2.}

\item{nprizes}{Total number of prizes for game simulations.}

\item{nrevealdif}{Number of doors Monty does not reveal between player decisions 1 and 2.}

\item{prize.index}{Door index for prize location in each game.}

\item{selectdec1}{Either "random" or a door index to choose for decision 1.}

\item{doorswitch}{Some number between 0-100 (percent chance to switch). Defaults to 1 (100 percent).}

\item{montyselect}{Indices of doors Monty reveals between decisions 1 and 2.}

\item{verbose.results}{Whether to return iteration/game details alongside results.}
}
\value{
A vector of game results, with simulation details if verbose.results = TRUE.
}
\description{
Run simulations of the Monty Hall problem. Default settings are canonical/classic game parameters, with arguments to change various parameters.
